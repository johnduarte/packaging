1) Notify [~#{vars[:builder]}], [~#{vars[:writer]}], [~#{vars[:developer]}], [~#{vars[:owner]}], [~#{vars[:tester]}] that the release is starting.

2) For each component and puppet-agent, ensure there is a *next* version. Often this will be the next z in x.y.z. However, if we are jumping to a new x or y release that skips an existing z version in jira, make sure those tickets are reassigned to the correct fix version, and the version is closed. For example, if we have tickets with fixVersion 4.3.3, but we decide to go from 4.3.2 to 4.4.0, then we need to reassign the tickets assigned to 4.3.3 and close that version in JIRA.

3) Create a public pair of queries for inclusion in the release notes/announcement. These allow easy tracking as new bugs come in for a particular version and allow everyone to see the list of changes slated for the next release (Paste their URLs into the "Prepare long form release notes and short form release story" ticket).

  {{affectedVersion in ("puppet-agent #{vars[:puppet_agent_release]}", "PUP #{vars[:puppet_release]}", "FACT #{vars[:facter_release]}", "HI #{vars[:hiera_release]}", "MCO #{vars[:mcollective_release]}", "pxp-agent #{vars[:pxp_agent_release]}", "cpp-pcp-client #{vars[:cpp_pcp_client_release]}")}}, Save as "Introduced in puppet-agent #{vars[:puppet_agent_release]}", click Details, add permission for Everyone

Remove unchanged components from the query, e.g. MCO 2.8.6, since we don't want to report on component fixes released in earlier puppet-agent versions.

1) Ensure that all tickets targeted at this release for all components are resolved.
  * Use the following filter to view all tickets for all components for this release: #{vars[:fixed_in][:all]}
  * Any tickets which are not resolved should be brought to the attention of the appropriate scrum team so they can be resolved for the release.
  * Verify tickets have release notes. Ping devs to update tickets with missing release notes.

2) Use the [ticketmatch|https://github.com/puppetlabs/ticketmatch] script to ensure all tickets referenced in the commit log have a bug targeted at the release, and ensure all tickets targeted at the release have a corresponding commit. This needs to be done for each component, including puppet-agent itself. This process may reveal tickets that need to be resolved, so this process may need to be repeated a few times.

  * cd ~/work
  * git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/ticketmatch
  * gem install highline (if you haven't already)
  * cd ~/work/<component> for each of puppet, facter, hiera, marionette-collective, pxp-agent, cpp-pcp-client, and puppet-agent
  * ruby ../ticketmatch/ticketmatch.rb
    Enter Git From Rev: <previous git tag> (i.e. 4.1.0)
    Enter Git To Rev: |master| stable
    Enter JIRA project: |<JIRA project>| (i.e. PUP)
    Enter JIRA fix version: <JIRA fixVersion to be released> (i.e. PUP 4.2.0)

The output may contain the following headers:

COMMIT TOKENS NOT FOUND IN JIRA (OR NOT WITH FIX VERSION OF ...)

Lists git commits that don't have a corresponding ticket, at least not for the specified fix version. If the commit has a ticket, but the ticket is not targeted correctly, then the ticket's fixVersion should be updated. This can frequently happen if a ticket is initially targeted for a future release (master), but is pulled into an earlier release (stable), but the ticket's fixVersion is not updated.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES NOT FOUND IN GIT

Lists JIRA tickets that have a matching fixVersion, e.g. PUP 4.2.0, but none of the commits have the JIRA ticket in the subject. If the JIRA ticket really is fixed in the release, e.g. the JIRA ticket was typo'ed in the git commit subject, then leave the ticket as is. If the JIRA ticket should not be fixed in the release, e.g. it was originally targeted for the release, but was later bumped out, then update the ticket's fixVersion accordingly, e.g. PUP 4.3.0.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES FOUND IN GIT

Lists JIRA tickets have a git commit, but the ticket is not resolved. Usually this is because the ticket is still passing CI or going through manual validation. It can also occur if a fix is made, but a problem is encountered, and the ticket is reopened. If that happens, make sure the ticket reflects reality, so it's clear the ticket is not actually fixed in the release. Follow up with the appropriate scrum team to ensure the ticket is resolved ASAP.

  * Make note in a comment of any tickets in git not found in JIRA (or visa versa) with an explanation of why the ticket is in that state.

DOC

  description[:code_ready] = <<-DOC
1) Check that the version number in source for each component is correct for the current release. This should have been done as the last step of the previous release.
  * Puppet: check {{lib/puppet/version.rb}} for the {{PUPPETVERSION}} variable.
  * Facter: check {{lib/CMakeLists.txt}} for the {{LIBFACTER_VERSION}} variables, and ensure the major, minor and patch settings are correct.
  * Hiera: check {{lib/hiera/version.rb}} for the {{VERSION}} variable.
  * Mcollective: check {{lib/mcollective.rb}} for the {{VERSION}} variable.
  * Pxp-agent: check {{CMakeLists.txt}} for the {{APPLICATION_VERSION_STRING}} variable.

2) Check that each component config in the puppet-agent repo points to the correct SHA for the release.
  * The configs are in {{configs/components/*.json}}.
  * Ensure that for each component, there are no new commits between the listed ref and the head of stable. Ensure your stable branch is up to date and use {{git log -pretty=oneline <ref>..stable}} to check for additional commits.
  * Ensure that the {{windows_puppet.json}} and {{windows_ruby.json}} configs point at the correct tags. Generally, the Windows team will have created these tags ahead of time, but this step may require tagging the respective Windows repos if not.
  ** Important! These configs *must* be pointing at actual tags, not SHAs!

3) Once the component configs in puppet-agent are verified to be correct, ensure that every component has successfully gone through CI.
  * First, check https://jenkins.puppetlabs.com/view/puppet-agent/view/stable/view/puppet-agent/ to ensure that the AIO daily job has completed successfully, and that all tests are passing.
  * Next, check https://jenkins.puppetlabs.com/view/puppet-agent/view/stable/view/pxp-agent/ to ensure that pxp-agent has passed all tests in CI.

Tag and create packages

1) Developer provides the SHAs for each component of puppet-agent *and* puppet-agent itself. [~#{vars[:developer]}] please add each SHA in a comment. These should match those in the puppet-agent component configs verified in step 1.

2) [~#{vars[:builder]}]: Do the following for each component of the release which has been updated (i.e, puppet, facter, hiera, etc). This is necessary to ensure gems and tarballs are created for each project.
  * Checkout the provided sha.
    * Make sure you are about to tag the correct thing.
  * Create the tag e.g. {{git tag -s -u \\{GPG key\\} -m "4.2.3" 4.2.3}}
    * You need to know the pass phrase for this to complete successfully. It's important that we make sure all releases are signed to verify authenticity.
  * {{git describe}} will show you the tag. Make sure you're building what you think you're building.
  * Make sure you look over the code that has changed since the previous release so we know what's going out the door.
  * run {{rake package:implode package:bootstrap vanagon:build_all}} when you've verified what version you're building (this uses the latest version of the packaging repo to build the packages).
  * Push the tag.

3) [~#{vars[:builder]}]: make a pull request against puppet-agent#stable to bump each component to the freshly pushed tags from above:
  {noformat}
{"url": "git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet.git", "ref": "refs/tags/#{vars[:puppet_release]}"} # puppet.json
{"url": "git://github.com/puppetlabs/facter.git", "ref": "refs/tags/#{vars[:facter_release]}"} # facter.json
... # Other components
  {noformat}

In addition, double check that {{windows_puppet.json}} and {{windows_ruby.json}} include the correct tags.

4) Once the above pull request has been merged, leave a comment in this ticket with the SHA of the merge commit and verify the build succeeds on at least one target with:
{noformat}
$ cd puppet-agent
$ env SSH_VANAGON_KEY=~/.ssh/jenkins bundle exec build puppet-agent el-7-x86_64
{noformat}

  * If the build succeeds, tag puppet-agent as #{vars[:puppet_agent_release]} and kick off a build at https://jenkins.puppetlabs.com/view/puppet-agent%20suite%20pipelines/job/platform_puppet-agent_init-van-int_suite-daily-#{vars[:puppet_agent_release]}-release/build?delay=0sec using the default set of parameters.
  * Notify [~#{vars[:tester]}] that the manual pipeline can be run for final validation on non-vmpooler platforms following the [Confluence instructions|https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/ENG/Puppet-Agent+Manual+Pipeline]
    ** The manual pipeline is likely to be red for a variety of reasons. It is the responsibility of [~#{vars[:tester]}] to shepherd this pipeline and triage any failures. Some segment of testing may need to be completed outside of Jenkins due to OOM-kill issue tracked by BKR-679
  * After the build, packages can be found in builds.delivery.puppetlabs.net/puppet-agent/#{vars[:puppet_agent_release]}

  description[:push_packages] = <<-DOC
Push packages

1) For all updated components *and* puppet-agent itself, do the following. This ensures that tarballs and gems are pushed for the component projects, and that the new puppet-agent package is shipped.
  * run {{rake pl:jenkins:uber_ship}}
    * You will need the keys to the castle (aka the passphrase) for this to work.
    * Don't forget to make sure everything looks like it's in the correct folder, the pkgs dir has been cleared out, and that you are shipping for all expected platforms.
    * Get a *second set of RelEng eyes* on the packages that are about to be shipped to make sure everything looks a-okay.
    * If you're shipping a gem you need to make sure you have a rubygems account, are an owner of that project, and have a gem config file.
    * The puppet-agent MSI for Windows needs to be manually signed.
    ** The signed MSIs need to replace the MSIs listed at builds.delivery.puppetlabs.net/puppet-agent/#{vars[:puppet_agent_release]}/shipped/windows/*.msi, but only after the ship task has been completed.
    ** The signed MSIs also need to be manually sent to downloads.puppetlabs.com:/opt/downloads/windows, and permissions need to be verified.
    ** This is a manual process and the ship task doesn't ship or build the msi so talk to Melissa, Morgan or Ryan for more details.
    ** RE-4364 has been filed to automate signing and shipping MSIs. This step can be removed when it is completed.

2) Verify that each component has had the correct bits pushed by the uber_ship. I.e, http://builds.puppetlabs.lan/puppet/#{vars[:puppet_release]}/shipped/ should include the gems and the tarball.

3) Push the agent packages up to S3 for inclusion in the corect branch of PE. Do that by running the jenkins job at http://jenkins-compose.delivery.puppetlabs.net/job/puppet-agent_s3-ship.

4) [~#{vars[:builder]}]: update the release google spreadsheet.

5) Disable auto-promotion to PE. View the Promote to PE job in https://jenkins.puppetlabs.com/view/All%20in%20One%20Agent/view/Stable/view/Puppet%20Agent%20Daily/ and click its 'Disable' button.

* Merge the release branch back into stable
* Review promotion of branch pipelines to PE
* Update PE pipeline version(s) as needed in ci-job-configs.

    * stable branch should promote to pipelines for previously released significant versions of PE (e.g 2015.3.x)

DOC

  description[:code_post_release] = <<-DOC
Bump the version number in source for each component in preparation for the next release.

  1) For each component, commit the updated version file in stable and merge it up into master:
  * Puppet: In {{lib/puppet/version.rb}}, update the {{PUPPETVERSION}} variable.
  * Facter: In {{lib/CMakeLists.txt}}, update each of the {{LIBFACTER_VERSION}} variables, and ensure the major, minor and patch settings are correct. In addition, update the {{PROJECT_NUMBER}} variable in {{lib/Doxyfile}}.
  * Hiera: In {{lib/hiera/version.rb}}, update the {{VERSION}} variable.
  * Mcollective: In {{lib/mcollective.rb}}, update the {{VERSION}} variable.
  * Pxp-agent: In {{CMakeLists.txt}}, update the {{APPLICATION_VERSION_STRING}} variable.

  2) For each component and puppet-agent, merge stable to master, resolving conflicts for each component as described in https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-agent/blob/master/README.md.

  3) For some releases, the master branch of a component may need to be merged down to stable.

*NOTE:* This is usually only during a x.y.0 release, but even then it may have already been done. If it doesn't apply, skip this step.

Assuming you have origin (your remote) and upstream (puppetlabs remote), the commands will look something like this:
{noformat}
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master

git checkout stable
git rebase upstream/stable

git merge master --no-ff --log
{noformat}

Once that looks good:
{noformat}
git push origin
git push upstream
{noformat}

After merging to stable, the jobs on jenkins may require updates (spec, acceptance, etc) when you merge master into stable. Please ensure that the jenkins jobs are updated if necessary.

If any new agent platforms were added in this release, you will need to update the puppet-agent.yaml file in ci-job-configs to copy the new platforms to the stable branch.

Note that when merging master into stable, the stable versions of the component config refs should be preferred should there be a merge conflict.

  * Destroy release branch
  * Is the code ready for release?

Make release tickets in JIRA for puppet-agent.
Tickets are created by specifying a number of environment variables, e.g.:

$ cd ~/work/puppet
$ gem install jira-ruby
$ rake pl:puppet_agent_release_tickets BUILDER=melissa DEVELOPER=kylo WRITER=nick.fagerlund OWNER=eric.sorenson TESTER=john.duarte PROJECT_MANAGER=steven.barlow PUPPET_AGENT_RELEASE=1.2.7 PUPPET_RELEASE=4.2.3 FACTER_RELEASE=3.1.1 HIERA_RELEASE=3.0.4 MCOLLECTIVE_RELEASE=2.8.6 PXP_AGENT_RELEASE=0.0.1 CPP_PCP_CLIENT_RELEASE=0.0.2 DATE=2014-04-01 JIRA_USER=kylo

The BUILDER/DEVELOPER/WRITER/OWNER/TESTER/PROJECT_MANAGER params must be valid jira usernames.

Because puppet-agent releases involve the release of multiple sub-components, RELEASE parameters are needed for each. This allows filters to be auto-generated. These parameters are freeform strings, so no validation is done against them.

The DATE param is a predicted date that this release ticket will be started. This is a hint to Release Engineering about when to prep for the release, but not a binding contract to release on that date.

The JIRA_USER parameter is used to login to jira to create the tickets. You will be prompted for a password. It will not be displayed.
